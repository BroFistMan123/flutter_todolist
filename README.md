# hello_world

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- List View
- Add ToDoList attributes
- 
## UPDATE
- It clears the textbox whenever button is submitted, it is then shown at the bottom print.
# IMPORTANT
### - If it changes then it is a stateful else a stateless widget
### - Callback pass a function to this TextInputWidget when it is pressed, it will call the function that it passed
### - {} in function makes it optional eg TextInputWidget({this.callback});
### - Expanded does is essentialy make sure everything we have in child fills the area as large space as possible. Take up entire screen.
